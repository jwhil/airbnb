Recreation of the airbnb mobile site.

## Breakdown
### Sections
The Airbnb mobile site can be split into four sections: header, hero, content, and footer.
#### Header section
The header is composed of 2 rows of containers which can themselves be broken down. The top container contains 2 buttons: the search bar and filters button. The bottom container contains a horizontal scrolling menu (id categoryScroller) comprised of repeating containers of hyperlinks to different sections of the website. It is a radio group in mobile view with JavaScript coding to navigate you upon clicking.
#### Hero section 
The hero section displays the top advertised homes from the category seleted from the horizontal scrolling menu on the airbnb website.
These can be thought of as large hyperlink containers navigating the user to the home of choice. These containers can be split broadly down into the picture and writing underneath.
At the bottom of this section is a smaller add on consiting of text and a button enabling the user to view more options.
#### Content section   
Begins with inspiration text and a scrolling menu (role = tablist) comprised of buttons. This is followed by a tabpanel with a list of hyperlinks to different pages. 
This is followed by the support section, a grid of unordered lists of hyperlinks. This layout is repeeated for the hosting and airbnb sections underneath it. This is followed by a flex layout section comprised of buttons for language and currency choice followed by text for the coopywrite and another unordered list of hyperlinks for privacy, terms, sitemap etc.
